This simple website uses twitters search API to find tweets. It either
finds them by keyword or by geographicaly location. Once found it plot them
on a google map if coordinates are provided in the tweet. Most tweets do
not indluce coordinates. It also uses an Ajax call to refresh the page
automaticaly with new tweets. See it in action at:
